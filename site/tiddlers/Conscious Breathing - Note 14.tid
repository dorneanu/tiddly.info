The skin is the bodyâ€™s largest organ, and when you breathe effectively, you send more health-giving oxygen to it. Few people realize that the skin is an organ that helps in the elimination of toxins from the body. If the breathing mechanism is not doing its job, the skin must take over some of the responsibility. When you learn to breathe well, you use the full potential of your lungs, which frees the skin from overwork. It will celebrate its new-found freedom by looking better.

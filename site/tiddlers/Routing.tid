!! Routing

Has 2 main concepts

* the process of routing forwards [[Layer 3]] packets, also called ''L3PDU'' (see [[TCP/IP - Encapsulation]]), based on the destination Layer 3 address in the packet
* the routing process uses the data link layer to encapsulate the Layer 3 packets into [[Layer 2]] frames for transmission across a data link

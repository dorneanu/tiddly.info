note: This package presents a helpful sidebar view for Org buffers. At the top is a chronological list of scheduled and deadlined tasks in the current buffer (similar to the Org agenda ,but without all its features), and below that is a list of all other non-done to-do items. If the buffer is narrowed, the sidebar only shows items in the narrowed portion; this allows seeing an overview of tasks in a subtree.
